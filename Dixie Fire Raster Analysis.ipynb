    "The 2021 Dixie Fire began on July 13, 2021 when a large fir tree fell on top of a 12-kilovolt power distribution line operated by Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E), resulting in the ignition of fuels on the ground beneath the transmission lines. By August 6, it has become the largest single wildfire in California's history, primarily impacting Plumas County, CA. Contributing factors to its spread included intensification of drought, overcrowded forest, and poor road access to the initial outbreak area making it difficult for emergency personnel to control the fire.\n",

    "On September 9, the weather conditions became more favorable with calmer winds, cool overnight temperatures, rain and increased humidity. By September 22, containment reached 95% and on October 1, the last remaining area became devoid of heat according to infrared data."
